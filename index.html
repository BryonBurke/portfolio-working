      <h2>About me</h2>

      <div class="background">
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>I served in the US Navy in the 80's as a Data Systems technician then at a defense contractor designing and editing tech manuals. After returning to Portland I became a sound tech and worked in most of the local venues. It was exciting but the pay was marginal. Around the mid 90's I started a recording studio which ended up going broke. I followed this with four more studios which also went broke after a couple years. The key factor was always building rent. In 2004 I started my current studio, Space Reording. This project has succeeded by specializing in live show recording, which does not need a building. My experience as a live sound engineer enables me to produce high quality recordings very quickly. I enjoy a relatively high hourly rate while keeping overall project cost to the band low. I now have a finely tuned rig and working practices, <span style="color:blue">but it has become boring.</span> I want to turn it back into a hobby so that I can record only with people I like vice taking anything that comes my way. I am now looking for a more <em>stable</em> career as an employee with defined tasks vice the chaotic nature of my studio.
